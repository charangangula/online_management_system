# online_management_system
An online shopping system using Java with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts involves creating a software application that simulates the process of shopping online. The system typically includes various components like products, customers, shopping carts, and orders. By employing OOP principles, the system is structured in a way that promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

Key OOP Concepts Applied
Encapsulation:

Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components.
Application: In the shopping system, classes like Product, Customer, ShoppingCart, and Order encapsulate their respective attributes and provide methods to interact with these attributes. For instance, a Product class may have private attributes for ID, name, and price, and public methods to access these attributes.
Inheritance:

Definition: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (subclass) inherits attributes and methods from another class (superclass).
Application: In this basic implementation, we might not use inheritance explicitly, but it's useful in more complex systems where you can create a base class for common functionality and extend it. For example, if you had different types of products (e.g., Electronics, Clothing), they could inherit from a base Product class.
Polymorphism:

Definition: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It provides a way to perform a single action in different forms.
Application: In this simplified example, polymorphism can be seen in method overriding (if extended). For instance, if you have different types of Order (e.g., OnlineOrder, InStoreOrder), you could override methods to handle specific behaviors for different types.
Abstraction:

Definition: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
Application: In the shopping system, abstraction is achieved by defining clear interfaces and methods for interacting with objects. For example, the ShoppingCart class abstracts the complexity of managing products and quantities, providing a simple interface for adding and removing items and calculating totals.
Description of Key Components
Product Class:

Purpose: Represents an item available for purchase.
Attributes: id, name, price.
Methods: Getters and setters for accessing and modifying product details. A toString method for displaying product information.
Customer Class:

Purpose: Represents a user of the shopping system.
Attributes: id, name.
Methods: Getters for accessing customer details. A toString method for displaying customer information.
ShoppingCart Class:

Purpose: Represents a shopping cart that holds items for a specific customer.
Attributes: customer, items (a map of Product to quantity).
Methods: Methods for adding and removing products, calculating the total price, and displaying the cart contents.
Order Class:

Purpose: Represents a completed order containing the shopping cart details.
Attributes: orderId, cart.
Methods: Getters for accessing order details. A toString method for displaying order information.
OnlineShoppingSystem Class:

Purpose: Contains the main method to drive the application and simulate the shopping process.
Functionality: Creates instances of Product, Customer, and ShoppingCart, adds products to the cart, and generates an order.
Example Flow
Product Creation: Define available products.
Customer Creation: Create a customer who will shop.
Shopping Cart Operations: Add products to the cart, remove products if needed, and view the cart.
Order Generation: Create an order based on the shopping cart contents.
Benefits of Using OOP
Modularity: Code is organized into classes that represent real-world entities, making it easier to manage and update.
Reusability: Classes can be reused and extended for future development, such as adding new types of products or implementing different order processing methods.
Maintainability: Changes in one part of the system can be made with minimal impact on other parts, thanks to encapsulation and abstraction.
